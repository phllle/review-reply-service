# Static assets for the signup page

Place the two Castle Nail Bar review screenshots here so they show in "See it in action":

- **review-example-1.png** — First Google review + owner reply (e.g. Austin Sayasone 5-star)
- **review-example-2.png** — Second Google review + owner reply (e.g. Sasha Faulk 5-star)

Copy your screenshots from Cursor assets or your desktop and rename them to match. They are served at `/review-example-1.png` and `/review-example-2.png`.
